    "- Data stored in multidimensional Numpy arrays, also called tensors. A tensor is a container for data. Tensors are a generalization of matrices to an arbitrary number of dimensions.\n",

    "## Scalar (0D tensors)\n",
    "A tensor that contains only one number is called a scalar. Number of axes of a Numpy tensor via the ndim attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors (1D tensors)\n",
    "An array of numbers is called a vector, or 1D tensor. A 1D tensor is said to have exactly one axis. A 5D vector has only one axis and has five dimensions along its axis, whereas a 5D tensor has five axes (and may have any number of dimensions along each axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrices (2D tensors)\n",
    "An array of vectors is a matrix, or 2D tensor. A matrix has two axes (often referred to rows and columns). \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3D tensors and higher-dimensional tensors\n",
    "Packing matrices in a new array gives a 3D tensor, visually as a cube of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key attributes\n",
    "- `Number of axes (Rank)` - 3D tensor has three axes, and a matrix has two axes. Use `ndim`\n",
    "- `Shape` - Tuple of integers that describes how many dimensions the tensor has along each axis."
